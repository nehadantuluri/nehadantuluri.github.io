        <h3>In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism.<br>The word diet often implies the
            use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-<br>management reasons (with the two often being related).
            Although humans are <br>omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some <br>food taboos.
            This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons.<br>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutrition needs differ with gender and age.</li>
                <li>As a man, your healthy diet will need to meet your unique physical needs,<br> fit with your lifestyle, and
                    reduce your risk of disease.</li>
                <li>A healthy diet for a man is different from a healthy diet for a woman.<br> And what a middle aged male needs
                    from his food for good health and growth <br>differs from what a male baby, child, teenager or older <br>person
                    needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>We can categorize men's nutrition according to their age. Let's see them:
            <h2>19 to 50 years</h2>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Younger men in this age bracket generally need more energy than older men,<br> but still need to eat in
                    moderation, with a good variety and balance</li>
                <li>There’s about 60 grams of protein in 100 grams of rump steak and <br>12.4 grams of protein in 40 grams of
                    reduced fat cheese. </li>
                <li>So it’s not much – and it’s easy to achieve if you’re eating protein-rich <br>foods like meat, poultry,
                    fish, dairy, legumes and lentils, eggs and nuts.
    
                </li>
                <li>To manage your weight, you’ll need to limit high kilojoule drinks, such as soft drinks,<br> energy drinks
                    and alcohol.</li>
        </h3>
        </ul>
        <h2>50 to 71 years</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By this age, your nutritional needs have changed from when you were younger.<br> As men get older, the key
                    is choosing foods that give you bang for your buck – that is, <br>foods that are nutrient-rich, without
                    excessive kilojoules.
    
                </li>
                <li>You need slightly less of some food groups, such as lean meats and eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>71 + years</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At this age, you need slightly fewer grain (cereal) foods and slightly more dairy foods and their<br>
                    alternatives, such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and calcium-enriched rice milk.</li>

            <h1>PHYSICAL HEALTH</h1>
        </u>
        <h3>Physical health is an important aspect of overall well-being for men, just as it is for women.<br> Taking care
            of one's physical health involves making healthy choices and engaging in regular exercise,<br> maintaining a
            balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding risky behaviors such as smoking,<br> excessive alcohol
            consumption, and drug use.</h3>
        <h3>Here are some specific aspects of physical health that are important for men to consider:</h3>
        <h2>Prostate health</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As men age, the risk of prostate problems such as an <br>enlarged prostate or prostate cancer
                    increases.<br>
                <li> Regular check-ups and screenings can help detect problems early <br>and increase the chances of
                    successful treatment.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>Testosterone</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, which can lead <br>to decreased energy, decreased muscle
                    mass, and changes in mood and libido.<br>
                <li> If you're experiencing symptoms related to low testosterone,<br> talk to your doctor about testosterone
                    replacement therapy.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>Heart health</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Men are at a higher risk for heart disease than women, so it's important<br> for them to take steps to
                    protect their heart health,such as maintaining<br> a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and
                    avoiding smoking and excessive <br>alcohol consumption.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>Sexual health</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Men should take care of their sexual health by practicing safe sex <br>and getting regular check-ups and
                    screenings for sexually transmitted<br> infections.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>Musculoskeletal health</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular exercise and stretching can help prevent injury and maintain <br>strong bones, muscles, and
                    joints.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>Remember, mental health is just as important as physical health and seeking help <br>is a sign of strength, not
            weakness.</h3>
