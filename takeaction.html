    <h1>The UN Campaign for
        Individual Action</h1>
    <b><p>
        To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2030 and to net zero by <br>
        2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. But the <br>
        transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in advanced <br>
        economies.
    </p></b>
    <h3><b>ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability.</b></h3>
    <p>Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By making choices that have less
        harmful effects on the environment,<br> we can be part of the solution and influence change.</p>
