    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <h3 style="color:black; font-size:21px;margin-left: 200px;">Over the last 15 years, the number of childhood deaths has been cut in half. <br>
        This proves that it is possible to win the fight against almost every disease. Still, we are spending <br>
         an astonishing amount of money and resources on treating illnesses that are surprisingly easy to prevent. <br>
         The new goal for worldwide Good Health promotes healthy lifestyles, preventive measures and modern, efficient <br>
          healthcare for everyone.Sustainable Development Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all, at every <br>
          stage of life. The Goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; <br>
          communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, <br>
           effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. It also calls for more research and development, increased <br>
           health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management.
